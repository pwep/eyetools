```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Steps

1.  Make changes to package components (scripts, data, etc)
2.  Use **`load_all()`** to make the updates available for use.
3.  Use **`document()`** to update the function documentation and NAMESPACE
4.  Use `check()` to make sure there are no errors, correct any warnings, etc.
5.  When happy the package is robust, use `install()` to provide access outside of development project.
6. Commit to github.
