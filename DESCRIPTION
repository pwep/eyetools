Description: A set of tools for easier eye data processing. It enables the automation of core actions across the pipeline from basic data
  formats of trial, time, x, and y coordinates, and standardises the processing of binocular data, fixing missing data, smoothing data, 
  and plotting eye gaze information. The toolset also offers event-related processing, such as calculating fixations, saccades, 
  and time in Areas of Interest. The tools are designed to work with data from any eye tracking device.
