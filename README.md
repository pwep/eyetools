# eyetools - a set of tools for eye data processing, analysis and visualisation in R

Vague "roadmap" for functions:

order | process | implemented function(s) | comment
--------
1.| interpolation | interpolate | working and provides a summary report of repair
2.| smoothing | |
3.| dispertion-based fixations  | |
4.| area of interest analysis   | |
5.| heatmaps (some sort of wrapper for easy ploting commands)  | |
6.| saccade detection (angle, speed, start/end, timing)  | |
7.| velocity based fixation detection (from saccades)  | |
8.| scan paths (OG to be prodded fiercely)  | |

19/08/2020 - interpolate seems to work. 
17/08/2020 - it doesn't do ANYTHING at the moment. Don't even think about using it.
